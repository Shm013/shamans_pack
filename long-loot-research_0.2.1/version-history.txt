Version 0.2.1
	- Requires Long Reach Distance v0.3.1 (from v0.3.0)
	- Added support to the command for resetting the technology and also the reach distance in all forces.
	- Decreased the amount of required science packs and research time for non-expensive technologies.

Version 0.2.0
	- Updated for Factorio 0.15.
	- Changed mod name from "Long Loot Research" to "Long Reach Research - Loot" for better mod grouping.
		- Mod ID is not affected.
	- Due to the absence of the alien artifact, this technology is not so important now, so it is made cheaper.
		- But you can still get back the expensive long loot technology by turning on Options > Mods > Startup > long-loot-research > Expensive technology.
		- Expensive technology mainly adds the requirement of military science packs.
	- Added Tier 5 technologies. See changelog of Long Reach Research v0.3.0.
	- Added information about the bonuses of the technologies.

Version 0.1.1
