day_length_multiplier = 4 

-- Controls how the day length will be increased.
-- Must be an integer !
-- Set to 1 for default vanilla length (7 minutes full day/night cycle).
-- With 4, it gives a 28 mins cycle.

adapted_accumulators = true -- if true then buffer size of accumulators is multiplied by day_length_multiplier to support longer nights.
