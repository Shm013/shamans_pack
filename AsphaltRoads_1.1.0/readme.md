# Asphalt Roads 1.1.0
---
## Introduction

*Have you ever looked at your factory and thought: "I dunno, but what this planet is seriously missing is a decent four-lane highway network."
Then worry not: This mod was made to help fulfilling your infrastructure dreams.*


**Asphalt Roads**

"Asphalt Roads" adds a new tile set with a smooth, black road surface to your games, including tiles for hazard marking and lane marking. Enjoy the reduced vehicle friction modifier and accelerate up to 200 km/h with your car (using rocket fuel). 

- Mark separate lanes on your roads with single or double lines
- Mark hazard areas in various colours e.g. near railway crossings or gates 
- Set up pedestrian crossings with zebra crossing or "shark teeth" tiles

- **Double line tiles** also consists of four separate items and are the main new addition in Version 1.1.0.

### Technology
Basic technology is called **Asphalt** and needs concrete as a prerequisite.

### Mod recommendation and support 

Recommended mods that work well in addition to this one:

- [Pavement Drive Assist](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Arcitos/PavementDriveAssist): Allows player driven vehicles to detect lane marking and follow your roads
 
- [Concrete Signpost](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Klonan/Concrete_Lamppost) (by Klonan) adds sign posts that look really nice in addition to asphalt roads

Supported mods

- [Bio Industries](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/TheSAguy/Bio_Industries): If present, crushed stone will be used as an ingredient for asphalt. This can be disabled in mod settings tab.

### Effects on gameplay

This mod is mostly non-game-changing, apart from the reduced vehicle friction of asphalt. But this is compensated by the significant amount of crude and heavy oil needed for the production of asphalt. For more fun, i recommend the heavy use of blueprints!

### Current language support

- EN (English)
- DE (German)

If you like this mod and you've created a translation of your own, please do not hesitate to send me this, so that it can be made accessible to all in the next version. Same, if you spot spelling mistakes. Thanks in advance!
