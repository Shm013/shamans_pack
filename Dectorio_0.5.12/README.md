# Dectorio

A simple mod that adds decorative elements to beautify your factory. New technology research is required to unlock the various items before they can be crafted and some default recipes are adjusted to better reflect how these items should be made.

Inspiration for the mod came from a lot of other mods on the Factorio mod portal, although all the assets in Dectorio have been custom made for this mod and are either modified versions of base game assets or created from scratch. If you'd like to use any of these in your own mod, please observe the GNU GPLv3 license.

Requires Factorio version 0.15 or later.

## How to install

Download the latest stable release from the [Factorio mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/PantherX/Dectorio) or at <https://github.com/jpanther/Dectorio/releases/latest> and copy the entire zip file to your Factorio mods directory:

* Windows: `%appdata%\Factorio\mods`
* Mac: `~/Library/Application Support/factorio/mods/`
* Linux: `~/.factorio/mods`

When you launch the game, the new mod will be enabled by default.

### General

* Includes settings for enabling or disabling each of the above features (Options > Mods > Startup). Ideally these should only be changed before starting a new game. Changes on existing games will require content to be migrated and some items may be lost if you disable components you've already used on an existing save. Always make a backup first!

* Items above marked ^ can be further customised in the config.lua file

### Bugs & Suggestions

Feel free to get in touch with any issues or suggestions for new features you'd like to see. You can get in contact via the 'Discussion' tab on the [Factorio mod portal](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/PantherX/Dectorio/discussion), the [Factorio Forums](https://forums.factorio.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=28042) or you can also view and log issues directly to the GitHub repo.

### Language Support

Currently the mod is only available in English. If you are able to translate the mod into an additional language, please let me know and I'll package it into the bundle for distribution (with credit to you).

### Mod Compatibility

Limited testing has been completed with other mods. Warnings will be shown in-game to highlight any known issues. If you come across a specific compatibility issue, please let me know and I'll see what I can do to fix it.

It is not recommended to use other coloured signal mods at the same time as Dectorio. This can cause coloured signals to be overwritten multiple times and lead to game-breaking compatibility issues with other mods. If you would like more colours, you can add these in the Dectorio config.lua file (instructions are in the file).
