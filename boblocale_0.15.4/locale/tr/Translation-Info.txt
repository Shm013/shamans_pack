Turkish translation by SperraDoz (pigeoncathcer/github)



SideNotes: 
-- bob-fluid-products=Bob'un Sıvı Yöntemleri is a bit off but otherwise it will call something else in Turkish :D.
-- There is literally no translation for "spawner" so I used something more like "maker"

TODO: 
--"filter-long-near-inserter=Filter long in near inserter" couldn't translate. Not enough info in the sentence.
