		- For the color presets, when a preset button is hovered, its color becomes opaque.

		- Color Picker - Player
		- Color Picker - Train Stop
		- Color Picker - Locomotive
		- Color Picker - Wagon
	- The color picker for the above entities will be opened by default instead of collapsed when the entity is selected.
		- It will also keep being opened when you select another entity that supports color picker.
	- Added runtime mod settings to disable the above color pickers.
	- Added the ability to copy-and-paste the color from a locomotive or train stop to cargo wagons or the other way around. It can be disabled with the new startup mod setting.

		- You can name the presets by alt-clicking the preset buttons.
		- You can quickly remove presets by shift-clicking the preset buttons.
		- Due to technical limitation, presets cannot be saved across different games. This may be solved in the future.
